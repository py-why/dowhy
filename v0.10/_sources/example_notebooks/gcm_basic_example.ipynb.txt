    "The first step is to model the cause-effect relationships between variables relevant to our use case. We do that in form of a causal graph. A causal graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where an edge X→Y implies that X causes Y. Statistically, a causal graph encodes the conditional independence relations between variables. Using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library, we can create causal graphs. In the snippet below, we create a chain X→Y→Z:\n",
