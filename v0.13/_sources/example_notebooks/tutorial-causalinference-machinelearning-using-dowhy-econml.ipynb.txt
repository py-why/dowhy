    "## Why causal inference?\n",
    "Many key data science tasks are about decision-making. Data scientists are regularly called upon to support decision-makers at all levels, helping them make the best use of data in support of achieving desired outcomes. For example,  an executive making investment and resourcing decisions, a marketer determining discounting policies, a product team prioritizing which features to ship, or a doctor deciding which treatment to administer to a patient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these decision-makers is asking a what-if question.  Data-driven answers to such questions require understanding the *causes* of an event and how to take action to improve future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a causal effect \n",
    "Suppose that we want to find the causal effect of taking an action A on the outcome Y. To define the causal effect, consider two worlds: \n",
    "1. World 1 (Real World): Where the action A was taken and Y observed\n",
    "2. World 2 (*Counterfactual* World): Where the action A was not taken (but everything else is the same) \n",
    "\n",
    "Causal effect is the difference between Y values attained in the real world versus the counterfactual world. \n",
    "$${E}[Y_{real, A=1}] - E[Y_{counterfactual, A=0}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Real and Counterfactual Worlds](images/real_vs_counterfactual_world.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, A causes Y iff changing A leads to a change in Y,\n",
    "*keeping everything else constant*. Changing A while keeping everything else constant is called an **intervention**, and represented by a special notation, $do(A)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, causal effect is the magnitude by which Y is changed by a unit *interventional* change in A:\n",
    "$$E[Y│do(A=1)]−E[Y|do(A=0)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the effect, the *gold standard* is to conduct a randomized experiment where a randomized subset of units is acted upon ($A=1$) and the other subset is not ($A=0$). These subsets approximate the disjoint real and counterfactual worlds and randomization ensures that there is not systematic difference between the two subsets (*\"keeping everything else constant\"*). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not always feasible to a run a randomized experiment. To answer causal questions, we often need to rely on observational or logged data. Such observed data is biased by correlations and unobserved confounding and thus there are systematic differences in which units were acted upon and which units were not. For example, a new marketing campaign may be deployed during the holiday season, a new feature may only have been applied to high-activity users, or the older patients may have been more likely to receive the new drug, and so on. The goal of causal inference methods is to remove such correlations and confounding from the data and estimate the *true* effect of an action, as given by the equation above. \n",

Related to the two kinds of variables above, there are two main identification methods for causal inference. \n",

More advanced supervised machine learning models also do not work and often are worse than simple regression, because they include additional regularization techniques that help in minimizing predictive error, but can have unwanted effects on estimating the causal effect. Therefore, we need methods targeted to estimate the causal effect. At the same time, we also need suitable refutation methods that can check the robustness of the estimate. \n",
