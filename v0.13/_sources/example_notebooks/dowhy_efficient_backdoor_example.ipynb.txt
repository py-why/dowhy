    "Consider the design of the following hypothetical observational study discussed in [Shrier & Platt (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2288-8-70). The aim of the study is to assess the\n",
    "effect of warm-up exercises on injury after playing sports. Suppose that a researcher postulates\n",
    "that the graph below represents a causal graphical model. The node warm-up is the treatment variable, which stands for the type of exercise an athlete performs prior to playing sports,\n",

    "compare the interventional means corresponding to different individualised treatment rules. Each\n",

For example, one such rule could be to allocate a patient to perform soft warm-up excercises when she has previous injury = 1 and team motivation > 6, but any other (possibly randomised) function of previous injury and team motivation to set the treatment variable could be of interest. More formally, the goal of the study is, for some set of policies such as the aforementioned one, to estimate the mean of the outcome, in a world in which all patients are allocated to a treatment variant according to one of these policies. We will suppose moreover that due to practical limitations, the variables genetics, pre-grame proprioception,\n",

We then create a list of all observable variables, in this case, all variables in the graph except genetics, pre-game proprioception, intra-game proprioception and tissue weakness. We then pass all this information to the ```CausalGraph``` class, to create an instance of it."

    "[Smucler, Sapienza and Rotnitzky (Biometrika, 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00306) proved that when all variables are observable, or when all observable variables are ancestors of either the treatment, outcome or conditional nodes, then an optimal backdoor set can be found solely based on the graph, and provided an algorithm to compute it. This is the algorithm implemented in the examples above. \n",

For the graph below, [Rotnitzky and Smucler (JMLR, 2021)](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume21/19-1026/19-1026.pdf) in their Example 5 showed that depending on the law generating the data, the optimal backdoor set could be formed by Z1 and Z2, or be the empty set. More precisely, they showed that there exist probability laws compatible with the graph under which {Z1, Z2} is the most efficient adjustment set, and other probability laws under which the empty set is the most efficient adjustment set; unfortunately one cannot tell from the graph alone which of the two will be better. \n",
