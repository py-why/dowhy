In case of `Website`, the latency would represent the time until a confirmation of the order is shown. For simplicity, let us assume that the services are synchronized, i.e., a service has to wait for downstream services in order to proceed. Further, we assume that two nodes are not impacted by unobserved factors (hidden confounders) at the same time (i.e., causal sufficiency). Seeing that, for instance, network traffic affects multiple services, this assumption might be typically violated in a real-world scenario. However, weak confounders can be neglected, while stronger ones (like network traffic) could falsely render multiple nodes as root causes. Generally, we can only identify causes that are part of the data.\n",
