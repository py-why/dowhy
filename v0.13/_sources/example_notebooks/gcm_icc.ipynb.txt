    "This notebook demonstrates the usage of the [intrinsic causal influence (ICC) method](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/janzing24a.html), a way to estimate causal influence in a system. A common question in many applications is: \"What is the causal influence of node X on node Y?\" Here, \"causal influence\" can be defined in various ways. One approach could be to measure the interventional influence, which asks, \"How much does node Y change if I intervene on node X?\" or, from a more feature relevance perspective, \"How relevant is X in describing Y?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we focus on a particular type of causal influence, which is based on decomposing the generating process into mechanisms in place at each node, formalized by the respective causal mechanism. Then, ICC quantifies for each node the amount of uncertainty of the target that can be traced back to the respective mechanism. Hence, nodes that are deterministically computed from their parents obtain zero contribution. This concept may initially seem complex, but it is based on a simple idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a chain of nodes: X -> Y -> Z. Y is more informative about Z than X, as Y directly determines Z and also incorporates all information from X. It is obvious that when intervening on either X or Y, Y has a more significant impact on Z. But, what if Y is just a rescaled copy of X, i.e., $Y = a \\cdot X$? In this case, Y still has the largest interventional influence on Z, but it is not adding any new information on top of X. The ICC method, on the other hand, would attribute 0 influence to Y as it only passes on what it inherits from X. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind ICC is not to estimate the contribution of observed upstream nodes to the target node, but instead to attribute the influence of their noise terms. Since we model each node as a functional causal model of the form $X_i = f_i(PA_i, N_i)$, we aim to estimate the contribution of the $N_i$ terms to the target. In the previous example, we have deterministic relationships with zero noise, i.e., the intrinsic influence is 0. This type of attribution is only possible when we explicitly model our causal relationships using functional causal models, as we do in the GCM module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will look at two real-world examples where we apply ICC."

Let's say our task is to improve the design process where we need a good understanding of the influences of our variables on the mpg consumption. The relationship between these features can be modeled as a graphical causal model. For this, we follow the causal graph defined in the [work by Wang et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585647) and remove all nodes that have no influence on MPG.
