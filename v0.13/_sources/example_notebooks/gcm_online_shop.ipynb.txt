    "Suppose we are selling a smartphone in an online shop with a retail price of $999. The overall profit from the product depends on several factors, such as the number of sold units, operational costs or ad spending. On the other hand, the number of sold units, for instance, depends on the number of visitors on the product page, the price itself and potential ongoing promotions. Suppose we observe a steady profit of our product over the year 2021, but suddenly, there is a significant drop in profit at the beginning of 2022. Why?\n",

    "In the following scenario, we will use DoWhy to get a better understanding of the causal impacts of factors influencing the profit and to identify the causes for the profit drop. To analyze our problem at hand, we first need to define our belief about the causal relationships. For this, we collect daily records of the different factors affecting profit. These factors are:\n",

    "- **Unit Price**: Price of the device, which could vary due to temporary discounts.\n",

    "- **Operational Cost**: Daily operational expenses which includes production costs, spending on ads, administrative expenses, etc.\n",
    "- **Profit**: Daily profit.\n",

    "After a successful year in terms of profit, newer technologies come to the market and, thus, we want to keep the profit up and get rid of excess inventory by selling more devices. In order to increase the demand, we therefore lower the retail price by 10% at the beginning of 2022. Based on a prior analysis, we know that a decrease of 10% in the price would roughly increase the demand by 13.75%, a slight surplus. Following the price elasticity of demand model, we expect an increase of around 37.5% in number of Sold Units. Let us take a look if this is true by loading the data for the first day in 2022 and taking the fraction between the numbers of Sold Units from both years for that day:"
